	<p class="kim-taehyung">Is Kim Taehyung Pure Korean?
In 2013, a project was born in South Korea, which subsequently largely determined the development of the music world. It was in July of this year that the boy band BTS was created.

The group has seven members, each of whom is dear to the fans in their own way. Some of them ask questions about the guys, in particular, whether one of the members of the notorious group, Kim Taehyung, is really a full-blooded Korean.

V on the stage focused his attention on the appearance of a natural stage master, dominating the space with just a glance, the appearance of a painterly genius and his original and sensual appearance. On the other hand, he posed for his fans in a cute V-pose or looked at the camera with a playful smile.
